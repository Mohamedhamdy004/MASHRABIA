MASHRABIA  
*A Digital Heritage Experience — Where Egyptian Tradition Meets Modern Design*

🌍 Overview  
**MASHRABIA** is a UI/UX web project that reimagines **Egyptian heritage** through an immersive digital platform blending **art**, **craftsmanship**, and **cuisine**.  
It transforms traditional culture into a **living, interactive experience**, allowing users to explore the depth and beauty of Egyptian identity in a contemporary way.

At its heart, MASHRABIA celebrates the idea that **heritage is alive** — not confined to museums or history books, but reflected in the art we create, the food we cook, and the crafts we continue to preserve.

🍲 Heritage Cuisine  
The culinary side of MASHRABIA invites users to rediscover Egypt’s traditional dishes — from *Koshary* and *Foul Medames* to *Mahshi* — through a modern, emotional lens.  
Users can explore recipes based on:
- **Mood** (e.g., comfort, celebration, simplicity)  
- **Available ingredients** (“What’s in my fridge?” feature)  

Each dish comes with a **story** — its cultural origin, symbolism, and how it connects to Egyptian art and lifestyle — turning food into a narrative experience rather than a mere recipe.

🎨 Digital Art Gallery  
A curated virtual space showcasing **handmade artworks** inspired by Egypt’s heritage.  
The gallery features:
- **Paintings, jewelry, and décor** rooted in traditional patterns like *Khayamiya* and *Nubian designs*  
- **Artist stories** and their cultural inspirations  
- Visual harmony between digital minimalism and authentic Egyptian aesthetics  

The design reflects the charm of traditional spaces like *Torath* or *Darb 1718*, combining **earthy tones**, **golden highlights**, and **ornamental motifs** to evoke a sense of belonging and artistry.

🧵 Traditional Crafts  
MASHRABIA also acts as a bridge between the **digital world and real artisans**.  
It features:
- Authentic, endangered crafts such as **pottery, weaving, and Khayamiya textiles**  
- High-quality visuals and background stories of the **craftspeople** behind them  
- The ability to **purchase or explore** products that may also appear as artistic pieces within the digital gallery  

This creates a living ecosystem where **art, craft, and culture** continuously inspire one another.

💡 Unified Experience  
Every element in MASHRABIA is connected:
- A user might discover an **artwork inspired by Khayamiya** patterns in the gallery.  
- Then, they can **buy a real Khayamiya piece** from the crafts section.  
- Finally, they might explore a **traditional dish** whose motifs or stories echo the same cultural roots.  

The result is a **seamless storytelling experience** — one that unites emotion, identity, and design in a single interactive journey.

🎨 Visual Identity  
The platform’s visual tone draws from the warmth and depth of Egyptian heritage:
- **Color Palette:** golden yellows, deep blues, and earthen browns  
- **Typography:** elegant yet readable, reflecting Arabic and modern fusion styles  
- **Motifs:** subtle Mashrabia-inspired geometric patterns across the UI  

The overall interface balances **tradition and minimalism**, ensuring the art and culture take center stage.
